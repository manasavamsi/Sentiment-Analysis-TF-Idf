 This contains my learnings during dissertation work that includes python code on machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM classifiers also feature extraction models like TF-IDF, variants of TF_IDF and ngram model
You can find the structured form of Twitter data of two politicians of India and the data is collected from the 2018 till the month before election. 
This model is developed not only to predict the elction outcome through twitter but to design a new hybrid model to reduce the dimension of the data as well as calculate the polarity scores of the words applied to TF-IDF and n-gram model.
This model is developed in the point that Lexicon approach of analyzing sentiments alone is not enough but additional work has to be done in order to imporove the scores of the sentiment of Tweets.
This project mainly discussed the usage of different weighting schemes applied on TF-IDF which improves the performance level of the model by increasing the accuracy.
Also, these models are applied on different supervised classifiers to compare the perfomance and the time utilized by these models.
